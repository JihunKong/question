## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Monorepo Setup**
   - NPM workspaces configuration
   - Shared TypeScript configuration
   - ESLint and Prettier setup

2. **Database Layer**
   - Prisma schema with all models
   - Support for questions, contexts, tags, evaluations
   - Version tracking and collaboration features
   - Seed data for development

3. **API Service**
   - Express server with TypeScript
   - JWT authentication
   - RESTful endpoints for all operations
   - Error handling and validation
   - Health checks

4. **Web Frontend**
   - Next.js 14 with App Router
   - React Query for data fetching
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Question creation and listing
   - Real-time collaboration support

5. **Realtime Service**
   - Socket.io with Redis adapter
   - Yjs integration for collaborative editing
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Auto-save functionality

6. **AI Processor**
   - FastAPI Python service
   - Multi-dimensional question evaluation
   - NLP-based analysis (BERT)
   - Asynchronous processing

7. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Railway.json for all services
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Environment variable management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (via Docker)
- Redis (via Docker)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   cd question-exchange-app
   ./scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

2. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   npm run dev

   # Or start individually
   npm run dev:api      # API on :3001
   npm run dev:web      # Web on :3000
   npm run dev:realtime # Realtime on :3002
   
   # AI processor (in separate terminal)
   cd services/ai-processor
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py       # AI on :3003
   ```

### Railway Deployment

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   railway login
   ```

2. **Create Project**
   ```bash
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Configure secrets in Railway dashboard
   - Set service URLs
   - Configure database connections

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for API endpoints
   - Add integration tests
   - Add E2E tests for critical flows

2. **Features**
   - Implement user profiles
   - Add notification system
   - Enhance AI evaluation algorithms
   - Add search functionality
   - Implement question recommendations

3. **Performance**
   - Add caching layer
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement CDN for static assets
   - Add monitoring and logging

4. **Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add input sanitization
   - Set up HTTPS
   - Configure security headers

## 📚 Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time**: Socket.io, Yjs, Redis
- **AI/ML**: Python, FastAPI, Transformers, BERT
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Deployment**: Railway, Docker

## 🤝 Architecture Decisions

1. **Microservices**: Each service is independently deployable and scalable
2. **Monorepo**: Simplified dependency management and code sharing
3. **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
4. **Railway**: Simple deployment with automatic scaling and monitoring
5. **Yjs**: Proven solution for real-time collaboration
6. **BERT**: State-of-the-art NLP for Korean text analysis
